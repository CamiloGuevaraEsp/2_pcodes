This set of codes are used to analyze two photon data when it is stored as multiple cycles
Be sure that your Matlab version has the imaging processing and signal processing toolboxes installed
The order of operations is: 
1- write2PhotonTProjMask_V2_CG_multCycles
2- uiDrawMultipleMasks
3-extractRegionsFromMaskedVid_zStack_multiplecycles
4-output2P_intensityVsTime_cellBodies (for this open and modify readTimeFromXML and keep the code shutterStartAndStopFromText in your folder)
5-read_data
